RELEASE DATE -10:30PM- (27/06/2025) V1.2

I despise long instructions and descriptions, so I'll cut it short.


1. Make sure you open this when your !Microphone is NATURALLY UNMUTED!
2. The Keybind is "INSERT" 
3. Don't mess with the icon / nircmd or It'll break

(Kinda Long but only if you're up for it and dislike the notification)

4. If you want to change the sound get a .MP3 convert to .WAV replace the two files in "Addons" (Muted/Unmuted) --- exactly renamed (1/1) nothing else and it'll work.


Enjoy!
